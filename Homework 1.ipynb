    "### Methods for exploring data include looking at various data aggregations and summaries, both numerically and graphically.  This includes looking at each variable separately as well as looking at relationships between variables.  The purpose is to discover patterns and exceptions. For numerical variables, histograms and box plots can be used to learn about the distributions of their value, detect outliers, and find other information relevant to the analysis task.  Similarly, for categorical variables, we can use bar charts.  Scatter plots of pairs of numerical variables can be used to learn about possible relationships and the type of relationship and to detect outliers.  Also, to scatter matrix plots, we can use correlation tables to identify the possible relationship between the variables. \n",

Which are nominal?"
